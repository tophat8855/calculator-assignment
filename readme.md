#Calculator
clone this repo to start the calculator assignment

You can open `index.html` to see the (nonfunctional) calculator page. You're gonna make it work!

`app.js` is provided and linked to the page for you, but it's blank. What's the first thing you write? (Without it, your JS won't be able to find any HTML elements on the page---why?)

Once you're able to get the elements on the page, you want to know about clicks to the buttons. How can you listen to click events on all the buttons? For debugging purposes, start by making sure you can log some data to the console whenever a button is clicked.

Great, now you know when clicks happen. What do you want to do when a user clicks a button? Do you want a number to display? Update the operator display? Clear a display?
